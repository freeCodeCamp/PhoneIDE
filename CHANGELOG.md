### 4.0.0 (unreleased)

#### Breaking changes and migration

- Removed the public `EditorState` implementation helpers `currentFileName`, `updateLineCount`, `handleFileInit`, `handleRegionFields`, `editorView`, `editorField`, and `linecountBar`. Read `Editor.path` for the file name, and rebuild `Editor` with the new `path`, `defaultValue`, or region boundaries to load different content. Use the `Editor` widget to render the complete editor; its gutter and fields are now internal.
- Removed the unused `EditorState.getFontSize` helper. Use `MediaQuery.textScalerOf(context).scale(options.fontSize)` when a host needs the scaled font size.
- `EditorState.getTextHeight` now uses `EditorOptions.fontSize` when its optional `fontSize` argument is omitted. It returns the scaled row height, including `EditorOptions.lineHeight`, rather than measuring a glyph. Pass an explicit `fontSize` if the host needs a different size.
- The `EditorState` text and scroll controllers are now `final` and owned and disposed by the editor. Do not replace or dispose them. Existing controller reads and updates remain available; toolbar integrations can continue using `textfieldData`.
- Removed the unused `Linebar`, `LinebarState`, and `Linebar.calculateTextSize` from `lib/editor/linebar.dart`. They were not exported by `phone_ide.dart`, but consumers importing that file directly must remove those imports. Use `EditorOptions.showLinebar` and the gutter options for the built-in gutter, or `TextPainter` for independent text measurement.
- Code rows now use a fixed strut with a default `lineHeight` of `1.5` and honor accessibility text scaling. Review fixed-height host layouts, and set `EditorOptions.fontSize` and `lineHeight` explicitly when matching existing designs.
- Host `InputDecorationTheme` no longer styles code fields. Configure editor, region, caret, selection, and gutter colors through `EditorOptions` and `EditorRegionOptions` instead. The default gutter border remains `#888888`; set `linebarBorderColor` to customize or hide it.
- Taps on unused editor space or the gutter now focus the main editable field. Focus changes no longer emit `onTextChange` or `editableRegion`; use `textfieldData` for focus/controller notifications and the text streams only for actual edits.
- Read-only editors reject toolbar/controller text mutations as well as keyboard edits. To replace read-only content, rebuild with a new `defaultValue`.

#### Added and fixed

- Update the active-line highlight independently of document layout on cursor movement; cache horizontal width measurements until content, diagnostics, or typography changes.
- Share source/visual line mapping across the gutter and diagnostics, and repaint diagnostic layers only when their inputs change. Hide decorative gutter numbers from accessibility navigation.
- Cover large documents, read-only toolbar input, initialization races, reseeding, subscription disposal, and active highlights after blur with behavior tests.
- Add per-editor syntax, caret, selection, active-line and diagnostic styling.
- Add an optional leading border that spans the full editable region as it grows.
- Focus the main editable field when tapping unused editor space or the gutter.
- Add Python highlighting and preserve IME composing underlines.
- Isolate code fields from host form decoration and replace gutter fields with text.
- Keep source and gutter rows aligned with accessibility text scaling and horizontal scrolling.
- Preserve edits and stream connections during live theme changes; stop reporting focus as a code edit.
- Add optional source diagnostics with bold line numbers, underlines and inline messages.
